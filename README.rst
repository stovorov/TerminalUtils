TerminalUtils
=============

|Build-Status| 

This library is a collection of some useful functionalities I needed while working a lot with unix terminal.
It includes:

1. progress bar
2. colored printing 
3. quick redirection of std_out to file
4. simple logging for profiling functions calls
5. simple tabular printing of containers

Tested for Python 2.6 and 2.7. Python 3.x is currently unsupported.

TODO:
  1. Support for python 3.x
  2. Add some of functionalities i keep in my mind...

DONE:
  1. Tests 100% for Python 2.x
