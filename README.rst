|Build-Status| 

This library is collections of some useful functionalities I used while working a lot with unix terminal.
These includes:

1. progress bar
2. colored printing 
3. quick redirection of std_out to file
4. simple logging for profiling functions calls
5. simple tabular printing of containers

Tested for Python 2.6 and 2.7. Python 3.x is currently unsupported.
